                <h1>Dog as pet</h1>
                <p>People really do love dogs more than other humans. New research has shown people are
                    more
                    empathetic to dogs than adult humans. This is because we see dogs as part of the family, rather than
                    just pets.
                </p>
                <h2>What Dr Evan MacLean says!!</h2>
                <p>
                    Dr Evan MacLean, a senior research scientist at Duke University said that dogs had learned to
                    ‘hi-jack’ the bonding pathway between parents and their children: “It’s really only in the last
                    couple of thousand years that we have kept dogs as pets, and dogs began to be able to relate to
                    humans in meaningful social ways.
                </p>
                <h3>He adds an example</h3>
                <p>when dogs are presented with an impossible task they quickly turn to humans to see what to do, just
                    like children do. Wolves don’t do that.
                    Yeah they doon't!
